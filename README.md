Welcome, invite you to check this project. There i have implimented many functionality:  registration and authorization using Spring Security, many hard operations with different entities, for example user, teams(user can create team and sent unique team invitational links to add new user to his team), tournaments(big entity with many relations, user can register one of his team to join tournament), tournament bracket(when the tournament starts, the tournament bracket is generated, that bracket has right number of stages that dependes on number of teams in tournament, admin that created tournament have opportunity to move teams that win to the next stage until tournament there no will be winner)
